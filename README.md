# Delta-3D-Printer

[Video](https://vimeo.com/131369209)

This project gives the hints for building a homemade Delta Printer. Using clay and a common air compressor it is possible to design complex shapes effortless. A list of the required componenents with a corresponding URL for easy internet finding is available. The firmware must be [adapted](http://www.repetier.com/documentation/repetier-firmware/rf-installation/) to match your personal 3D Delta printer size if they differ from the foresaid list.

Best results using simple clay from any DIY store :

300gr Clay for 0.05 liter of water
Air Pressure : It depends on the extruder, test between 0 atm to 2 atm. The dryer the printing material, the higher the pressure.

Use Repetier Host to connect to the printer and slice the STL shapes with Slic3r. Settings screenshots upcoming.

[Video](https://vimeo.com/131369209)

This project gives the hints for building a homemade Delta Printer. Using clay and a common air compressor it is possible to design complex shapes effortless. A list of the required componenents with a corresponding URL for easy internet finding is available. The firmware must be [adapted](http://www.repetier.com/documentation/repetier-firmware/rf-installation/) to match your personal 3D Delta printer size if they differ from the foresaid list.

Delta printers are accurate and are the source of an infinite number of unique creations. They allow a large quantity of mouvements and their space path are well defined thanks to plenty of enthousiasts on the web who create every day simpler tools and more accessible ideas.

The Mega Set gathers everything we need to build a complex machine accesible to anybody.

Best results using simple clay from any DIY store :

300gr Clay for 0.05 liter of water
Air Pressure : It depends on the extruder, test between 0 atm to 2 atm. The dryer the printing material, the higher the pressure.

Use Repetier Host to connect to the printer and slice the STL shapes with Slic3r. Settings screenshots upcoming.

# Printing Material

Using any kind of clay from any DIY store, you can obtain some very nice results by mixing it with a small amount of water. I personally add 0.05 liter of water for 300gr of clay and an air pressure of about 1 bar. You need to find the perfect balance in the mixing recipe and the corresponding air pressure needed to achieve the best of the 3D printing. 

A too wet mixing will collapse under its own weight while a too dry mixing might induce issues with the air compressor and the water tightness of the extruder.
